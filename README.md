# CS300_Portfolio_Piece

  What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The code in this project was designed for the computer science department at the fictitious company ABCU.  The code loads information about the universities courses and validates that the courses have a valid format.  Courses are then either individually printable or printed in alpha-numeric order.

  How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I approached this problem by analyzing the pros and cons of each data structure.  Based on the specifications, the data structure must be able to maintain total ordering, and have fast search and delete times.  I chose a binary search tree for its fast operations while maintaining total ordering.  Choosing the right data structure improves the speed and memory efficiency of a program.

  How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

The largest problem I faced in this project was an assignment restriction of all my code having to be in one file.  TODO THIS
